# adguard-extension-settings

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of AdGuard's browser extension :)

**NOTE:** For AdGuard on Safari on iOS, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-safari-settings-ios), and for AdGuard on Safari on macOS, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-safari-settings-macos).

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-extension-settings), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/adguard-extension-settings).

# General

**Block search ads and websites' self-promotion** -> ✅

**Phishing and malware protection** -> ❌ *(Use [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/) instead)*

**Activate the most appropiate filters automatically** -> ✅

**Auto-update filters** -> `1 hour` *(If this causes you any issues, you can set to `6 hours` instead)*

# Filters

I would generally recommend enabling most of the built-in filters, besides those under the `Language-specific` category & some of those under the `Other` category. These are all extremely carefully picked lists with strong coverage and minimal breakage, and I would recommend enabling them as follows for the best coverage possible.

**Ad Blocking** -> ✅

* `AdGuard Base filter` -> ✅

<br>

**Other** -> ✅

Other:

* `AdGuard DNS filter` -> ✅  *(Only enable this if you don't also have DNS content blocking with this list enabled in place, otherwise keep this list disabled and re-disable the `Other` category)*

<br>

**Custom** -> ✅

Custom:

I would recommend importing the following lists:

* ⭐️ `Divested - Fingerprinting` - `https://codeberg.org/divested/dnsbl/raw/branch/master/Fingerprinting.ubl`

* ⭐️ Yokoffing's `Block third party fonts`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/block_third_party_fonts.txt`

Additionally, if you don't have a DNS content blocking solution in place *(you should)*, or you just can't use the relevant list on your DNS blocker, you should import the following:

* ⭐️ My `BadBlock`: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/badblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt`

* ⭐️ `Divested Combined Blocklist`: `https://divested.dev/hosts-domains-wildcards`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Badware Host Blocking`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/hoster.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Most Abused TLDs`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/spam-tlds-ublock.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi Multi PRO++`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/pro.plus.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Threat Intelligence Feeds`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/tif.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi/xRuffKez's Newly Registered Domains (14 days)`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xRuffKez/NRD/main/nrd-14day_adblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `OISD - Big`: `https://big.oisd.nl`

Additionally, if you're fine with a little breakage, I would highly recommend:

* ⭐️ My `BadBlock `**+** instead of `BadBlock`: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/badblock_plus.txt`

* ⭐️ `1Hosts Pro`: `https://o0.pages.dev/Pro/adblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi Multi` **Ultimate** instead of `HaGezi Multi` **Pro++**: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/ultimate.txt`

# Stealth Mode

**Stealth Mode** -> ✅

General -> **Block trackers** -> ✅

General -> **Remove tracking parameters** -> ✅

General -> **Hide your search queries** -> ✅

General -> **Ask websites not to track you** -> ✅

Cookies -> **Self-destruction of third-party cookies** -> ✅

Cookies -> **Self-destruction of third-party cookies** -> Your choice, the shorter the better, I usually leave at the default of `2880`

Miscellaneous -> **Hide Referrer from third parties** -> ✅

Miscellaneous -> **Disable WebRTC** -> ❌ *(As long as you're using a private browser like Firefox or Brave, then there really isn't a point or benefit from setting this IMO)*

# User rules

**User rules** -> ✅

User rules:

This is where it can really depend on you and your set-up. I'll provide my recommendations and filters here I myself use below:

First, I would highly recommend setting the following to protect against [IDN Homograph attacks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) *You don't need to set this if your DNS provider already provides IDN Homograph Attacks Protection (i.e. NextDNS)*:

* `xn--*`

* `xn--*$doc,popup,frame`

I usually also set the following to always enforce blocking Google's Doubleclick & Google Analytics: ((Why?)[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-stuff])

* `||doubleclick.net^$important`

* `||google-analytics.com^$important`

Additionally, I set the following to block social media tracking on websites:

* `||facebook.com^$important,third-party`

* `||facebook.net^$important,third-party`

* `||linkedin.com^$important,third-party`

* `||instagram.com^$important,third-party`

* `||tiktok.com^$important,third-party`

I also set this to block [tracking from Gravatar](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-stuff):

* `||gravatar.com^$important,third-party`

I also set these rules to block 3rd party sign-in prompts from Google & Apple, as they're 1: annoying and 2: a tracking concern:

* `||accounts.google.com^$third-party`

* `||appleid.apple.com^$third-party`

* `||appleid.cdn-apple.com^$third-party`

* `@@||accounts.google.com^$domain=youtube.com|chromium.org|gstatic.com|googleusercontent.com`

* `@@||appleid.apple.com^$domain=appleid.cdn-apple.com`

* `@@||appleid.cdn-apple.com^$domain=appleid.apple.com`

Finally, I usually set the following to block the annoying banner on Old Reddit promoting Reddit's new UI.

* `www.reddit.com###redesign-beta-optin-btn`

* `old.reddit.com###redesign-beta-optin-btn`

Once you are done here, make sure to select `Save`.

# Additional settings

**Use optimized filters** -> ❌

**Invert allowlist** -> ❌ *(Should be default)*

**Help with the development of AdGuard filters** -> ❌

**Show information on the AdGuard full version** -> ❌

**Notify about extension updates** -> ✅

# Additional recommendations

* Use a privacy-respecting browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with my [Phoenix](https://phoenix.celenity.dev).[text](../Phoenix/.github)

* Enable Safe Browsing in your browser if possible and if it's not done in a privacy-invasive way. (You should use i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Standard" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Firefox's Safe Browsing](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work), & [Brave's Safe Browsing](https://brave.com/privacy/browser/#safe-browsing), you should avoid most other options i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Enhanced" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Microsoft SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/), & [Opera Sitecheck](https://blogs.opera.com/security/2021/01/making-browsing-safe-from-phishing/)).

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration if you are able to *(See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings))*, otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/). *(Even if you have a private/secure DNS provider set on your OS/network level, make sure to also set it in your browser as well, so that you can take advantage of [Encrypted Client Hello](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello))*

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible. On Windows, you can use the built-in [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender_Antivirus), on macOS, you can stick to the built-in [XProtect](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web), on Android, you can use [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/), and on Linux, you can use [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/). **NOTE:** You should install Hypatia through the [DivestOS Official Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467) instead of F-Droid's main repo, as it will allow you to receive quicker updates directly from the developer. It's also recommended to use [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your F-Droid client of choice.
